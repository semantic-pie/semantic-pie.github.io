Title: "Usage"
---

Basically, all controls should be intuitive, but here are the basic interface functionality available now:



## Authorization (Optinal)

Authorization allows you to like tracks and generate a personalized playlist. But you can view and listen to music without authorization.
Authorization is as simple as possible, in the `test-interface` (http://localhost ):
`SignUp` -> enter username, password + select your preferred genres (the list of genres is formed based on the genres of uploaded tracks) -> tap `SignUp`. If `Hi, {username}` appears, then everything is ok.
