Title: "Track uploading"
---

After the command `./control.sh run` URLs will be accepted:

 - `http://localhost` - test-interface
 - `http://localhost:8000` - sc-web 

To add tracks to the knowledge base, go to the url `http://localhost:8000 ` (sc-web) and in the search field find a node named `file loader`. A track loader form will appear, select the tracks in mp3 format `Choose Files` and click `Upload`. After uploading, the tracks will be available in the test-interface (`http://localhost`).
